#How to manage branches on github
https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches

Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :
git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]

Change working branch :
git checkout [name_of_your_new_branch]

Push the branch on github and set upstream:
git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch] -u
git push --set-upstream origin 3-multiple-components

see all branches created by using :
git branch

see the changed files
git status

merge develop or master to your own functional branch
git merge origin/develop
or
git merge origin/master

reset the branch to previous changes
git reset --merge

Renaming the existing branch
git branch --move <old_name> <new_name>
but to push it, you must delete the old and push the new

git checkout <new_name>
git push origin [--set-upstream] <new_name>
git push origin --delete <old_name>
